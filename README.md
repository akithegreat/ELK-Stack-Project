# ELK-Stack-Project

## Cloud Network
This is a collection of Linux Scripts and Ansible Scripts from my CyberClass.
Most of the scripts are used to configure cloud servers with differnt docker containers.

The final setup was 4 servers running vulnerable DVWA containers along with a jump box and a server running an ELK stack container.


## Automated ELK Stack Deployment

The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.

These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the Ansible (_YAML__) file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.
